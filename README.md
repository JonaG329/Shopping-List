Shopping-List
A program that allows you to edit an existing shopping list in Python.
You begin with the following items in your shopping list: "Milk", "Rice", "Chicken", "Apples", "Olive oil", "Bread", "Cheetos"
You are given the options: Add a task to the to-do list, View the current to-do list, Mark a task as completed, Remove a task from the to-do list, Exit the program, Remove all tasks from the list, Sort the list alphabetically, Count the # of Items on the list.
If select a certain option, it will allow you to do that specific command, and when you are done it gives you the options again until you exit the program. 
In the future, I would like that this project could accept any form of text (upper or lowercase) instead of the exact word of the options. I would also love for it to have a visual of the list so you can see what you are working with in real-time, instead of having to view the list as a command separately.

Disclaimer: When marking a task as complete and removing a task from the list, make sure to spell out the word exactly how it is in the shopping list, otherwise there will be an error.
